# LSTM-model
Simple LSTM model 
This is the basic outline of the LSTM model. we can use it for prediting time series data like stock market and so on.
Here there are 3 hidden layer(2 LSTM layer of 128,64 neuron and 1 dense layer of 25 neuron) and 1 output layer with 1 neuron
The layer and neuron may differ according to complexity of your data and problem
